# CSC110-variable-lab


**My Variable Lab**  

My program is calculating a person's weight on several planets in our galaxy.
I was provided with a sample program and it helped me develop the work.
>
It was simple to create most of the project using basic java codes.
**For example, by using**: 
- A. class
- B. methods
- C. functions
- D. variables & finally
- E. designing the values in an orderly manner to complete the work.
>
The project works as you input values for the **"int"** class and use the **"Earth Mass Ratio"** of different planets.
>
The difficulty I encountered was in making the final part of the project.
I was unable to use the **"status"** class properly to determine the value of the person on different planets. 
Eventually, my instructor showed me how to use the **"double"** variable and figure the output.
So, I thanked my professor for his help and was finally successful.
>
The project is well suited for use in the specified planets with the given **"Earth Mass Ratio"** and won't work for other planets unless you know the values of the other planets and inupt the data in the form.
>
Aside from that it was a learning process for me and I had a great time creating the project. I look forward to developing more of the same in the
future lab classes.
